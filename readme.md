Running this project requires the IEMOCAP dataset.
Use the data_sort.py script to sort and label the data from the IEMOCAP dataset.
Then use preprocess_data.py to transform audio files into matrices.
Once the data is prepared you can run any of the train_* scripts to train the appropriate model and generate its weights.
